             I love the coastal town of Mombasa, which is where I work and live with my family. I grew up watching cartoons like the Roadrunner show, Popeye
              the sailor and my most favorite Tom and Jerry. I have been to Mt. Kenya and got mountain sick with just 4 kilometers to the peak.
              I started my professional career as a teacher in a vocational technical training institute,
              teaching computer subjects like programming in C++, PASCAL, Data Communication and MySQL databases
             to college students. I started my Cisco career in 2011 and certified for CCNA in September 2015, in 2019 July I completed my CCNP
              and that was how my career changed. To simulate networks, I use <a class="eve-ng" href="https://www.eve-ng.net">EVE-NG</a> which is a pretty awesome
              tool to build network topologies and test multivendor technologies.
