# Profile page
HTML and CSS are important skills for building webpages. This design was done in PowerPoint and then converted to a webpage. The design was inspired by the new way of being Agile, and the increasing demand for solutions to network problems. Being a network engineer is not enough, thus the modern network engineer has to learn new skills in AWS, Linux, Python, Ansible, Django, Git, Docker, and network security.
