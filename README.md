# Professional Profile Page
This is a minimalist design achieved using HTML and pure CSS to build the page. The design was inspired by the journey taken towards achieving relevant digital skills which may seem at times like being at sea. The modern network engineer is faced by a fast paced business environment to deliver solutions continuously, thus the modern network engineer has to learn new skills in AWS, Linux, Python, Ansible, Django, Git, Docker, and network security.
